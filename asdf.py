USE SAME LOCATION ALGORITHM TO ASSIGN 'RELEVANT ACTIVE REGIONS' to SHARPs
to also assign to parameterizations. Also copy over code for custom HARP

ALSO ALL THE CHANGES WE'RE MAKING TO INCORPORATE PARAMETERIZATIONS
SHOULD BE GOING IN UNIFY!!! AddAllEvents should not have to assume those
parameters are also there.

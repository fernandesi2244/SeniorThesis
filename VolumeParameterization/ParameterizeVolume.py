    Calculate the total magnetic energy in a Cartesian volume.
    =================================================
    Parameters:
    - bx_3D, by_3D, bz_3D : 3D numpy arrays representing magnetic field components in x, y, z directions.
    - target_ar_gen : The targetARGen of the volume file.

    This function computes total volume magnetic energy. The units for magnetic energy in cgs are ergs. The formula B^2/8*PI integrated over all space, dV
    automatically yields erg for an input B in Gauss. Note that the 8*PI can come out of the integral; thus, the integral is over B^2 dV and the 8*PI is divided at the end.

    Total magnetic energy is the magnetic energy density times dV. To convert ergs per centimeter cubed to ergs, simply multiply by its volume per pixel in cm:
      erg/cm^3*(CDELT1^3)*(RSUN_REF/RSUN_OBS ^3)*(100.^3)
    = erg(1/pix^3)
    
    Free magnetic energy in active regions typically ranges between 10^31 and 10^33 erg depending on the region's size, field strength, and complexity.
